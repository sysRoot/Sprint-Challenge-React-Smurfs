1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
	>> Client side routing takes place behind the scenes on the end-users computer versus server side rendering, which renders the page on the originating server and then serves a pre-compiled page complete with routes. Client side routing allows the developer to take care of dynamic data unlike server side rendering which is typically static data where as a client side routed app is usually a SPA rendered using javascript on the fly

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
	>> HTTP is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, and is used for facilitating the sending and receiving data between a client/end-user and a node/server

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
	>> CRUD is the Create Read Update Destroy methodology.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
	>> We can use Get to Read, Post to Create Put or Patch to Update and Delete to Destroy
