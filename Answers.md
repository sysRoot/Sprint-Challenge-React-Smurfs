1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Server side routing takes place on the server and is handled typically by physical individual static pages being served via a web server such as Apache or Nginx, by processing the urls and serving up the individual pages as requested, though it is not always static pages. Sometimes it is a route on node pointing to different apps that while seem single page, aren't always. Sometimes they're individual apps linked and set to act as one page. Client side routing is used typically to emulate browsing individual pages on the browser (user's) side, whilst inside a single page app. There are also other ways/reasons to perform client side routing, but it most commonly used to emulate multipage sites through routes in the current scene

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

    Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. Introduced officially in 1991 and standardized in between late '95 and early '96, Tim Berners-Lee had jump-started the development of this technology as a way to reliably get hypertext files from a centralized network.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

    Create, Read, Update, Delete. It is the functionality style of basic file storage and retrieval, typically against a database, api, or server. It use used for creating a piece of data, reading the created data, making modifications to the stored data, and deleting the stored data

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    POST is used to C)reate data, GET is used to R)ead data, PUT and PATCH are used to U)pdate the data where the former replaces the stored copy with a new copy and the latter modifies the existing copy, DELETE is used to D)elete the stored data from the source.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    Fetch, Axios, and jQuery's .ajax method are four , unfortunately I don't really know enough of the differences between them to commentate on their comparative efficiency.
